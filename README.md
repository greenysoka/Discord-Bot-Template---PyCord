# Bot-Template Repository
### by Greeny

This repository is for me and for everyone who wants to start coding discord bots with Py-Cord (Python).
I'll provide a short instruction to help you starting.
If you need any help please contact me on discord: @greenydev.

###CONSIDER
This is not an official template from Py-cord developers. It is essentially a template for myself so that I don't have to start from scratch with every bot. 
Optimizations & improvements will be made as soon as necessary.

# STEP ONE > Create a discord bot
Open the [Discord Developers Website](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

Click on "New Application" on the top right corner of the website:
