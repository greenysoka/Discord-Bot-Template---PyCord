# Bot-Template Repository
### by Greeny

This repository is for me and for everyone who wants to start coding discord bots with Py-Cord (Python).
I'll provide a short instruction to help you starting.
If you need any help please contact me on discord: @greenydev.

### CONSIDER
This is not an official template from Py-cord developers. It is essentially a template for myself so that I don't have to start from scratch with every bot. 
Optimizations & improvements will be made as soon as necessary.

### Requirements
- Installed Python Version 3.11 or below (NOT 3.12!)
- Visual Studio Code or another coding app
- Discord Account and a own server with admin permissions

## STEP ONE > Create a discord bot
Open the [Discord Developers Website](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

Click on "New Application" on the top right corner of the website:

Enter a powerful name and accept the ToS:

Now you're on the dashboard of your own discord bot. Go to the tab "Bot".
You can give your bot a profile picture and a banner. But that's up to you.
We're only interested in the privileged gateway intents. Activate the three options from the picture below:
